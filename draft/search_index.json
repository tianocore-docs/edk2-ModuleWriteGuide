It contains a metadata file (INF) plus source code or binary. The INF\nfile is required by the EDKII build system to describe a module's behavior,\nsuch as produced or consumed library classes, ppis, guids, protocols, pcds, and\nother information.\nFor example, in $WORKSPACE\\MdeModulePkg\\Universal\\Bus\\Pci\\UhciDxe, the source\nfiles mentioned and the INF file compose a module.\n,Refer to the EDK II Extended INF Specification. for the syntax of the INF\nfile.\n1.1.1.2 What is a Package?\nA package is a group of zero or more modules. A package must contain a package\nmetadata file (DEC), and possibly a platform metadata file (DSC).\nFunctionally, a package is a logical division of a project. Developers depend\non reasonable judgment, such as license or specification compliance, to\ndetermine where to place a module. These metadata files and the module's INF\nfiles are used by the EDK II build system to automatically generate makefiles\nand a single module tip or whole flash tip, according to the build options used.\nFor information regarding the syntax of DSC and DEC files, please refer to EDK\nII DSC File Specification and EDK II DEC File Specification.\n1.1.1.3 What is a Platform?\nA platform is a special type of package with additional metadata files. A\npackage must contain one DSC file and zero or one FDF file. The FDF is only\nrequired if flash output is required.\nRefer to EDK II FDF File Specification for information regarding FDF files..\nRefer to the EDK II Platform Port Guide for information about platform\nporting between EDK and EDK II.\n1.1.2 Module Customization\nUse the EDK II User Manual to understand the design purpose of the Library\nclass/Library instance and PCD mechanisms. These mechanisms provide ways for\ndevelopers to customize modules without changing the source code.\n1.1.2.1 Library class/Library instance\nDevelopers may choose a proper library instance according to its requirements,\nsuch as from performance, image size, or the limitation of module type.\nIn $WORKSPACE\\MdePkg core package, there are many supported library classes and\ncorresponding library instances. Browse the $WORKSPACE\\MdePkg \\include\\library\ndirectory for basic information regarding the helper function API provided by\nthese library classes.\n1.1.2.2 PCD\nDevelopers may take advantage of the PCD mechanism to extract information from\noutside a module, and control procedure behavior inside a module. The\ninformation may be known at compile time from the platform DSC or the package\nDEC files, but some files may arrive at flash image generation time, and some\nmay be determined during execution.\nExample:, in the following chapter, PcdDebugPropertyMask declared in\nMdePkg.dec file in $WORKSPACE\\MdePkg is used to control DebugLib behavior. This\nPCD is FixedAtBuild type, meaning its value is determined at build time. The\nEDK II build system converts this pcd to the value configured in DEC or DSC to\nenable or disable the print ability.\n1.1.3 EDK II Development Lifecycle\nThe lifecycle of EDK II development is divided into the five phases which\nfollow.\n1.1.3.1 Phase 1: Create a package\nA package is the container of modules. A developer should first consider where\nthe module should be placed. As a general rule, modules newly developed by an\nIHV/IBV should not be placed into existing EDK II core packages, which include\nMdePkg,\n4BThe Basics of EDK II\nMdeModulePkg, IntelFrameworkPkg and IntelFrameworkModulePkg. One reason\nis that these packages are published as a base-supported package to facilitate\nmodule/platform development.\n\nNote: These packages are open-source code and compliant with the BSD\nlicense. If the developed module is not intended to be open source, it should\nnot be put into those core packages.\n\nTo create a new package, developers must create the DEC file to define the\npackage's interfaces, including:\n\ninclude directories for modules from other packages\n\nthe value of GUIDs\n\nthe value of Protocol GUIDs\n\nthe value of PPI GUIDs\n\nthe declaration of the PCD entries published by this package.\n\n\n1.1.3.2 Phase 2: Create module metadata/Implement basic functionality.\nAfter the module to be placed into a package is determined, developers must\ncreate an INF file to indicate the module's behavior, including:\n\nmodule type\n\nrequired library classes\n\nrequired ppi/protocol/guid/PCD\n\ndependency relationship with other modules.\n\n\n\nNote: Dependency relationships may exist or not, depending on various\nmodule types.\n\nViewing a module's INF file provides a quick overview to an unfamiliar module.\nAfter finishing the INF file, developers should start writing source code to\nimplement basic functionality.\n\nNote: In $WORKSPACE\\MdePkg\\Include\\Library directory, there are many\nlibrary classes to provide support functions. There are also entry point\nlibraries for various module types. Developers should browse the header files\nfor details.\n\n1.1.3.3 Phase 3: Create DSC to build\nIn EDK II, the DSC file describes the build behavior of the package, including:\n\nmodules needed to be built\n\nchosen library instances for various module type\n\nthe configuration of the PCD entries used by modules.\n\n\nThe single platform DSC and each referenced package's DEC files cooperate to\ndefine a package. These files and the module INF files are required to build\nall modules in the package.\n1.1.3.4 Phase 4: Tune modules\nTo tune modules\n\nuse EDK II libraries for code reuse\n\nuse EDK II PCD mechanism for configuration.\n\n\nThe distinction between an EDK module and an EDK II module is that the EDK II\nmodule can be customized either statically or dynamically, as necessary.\n\nStatic customization is preferred to choose the library instance or determine\nthe value of FeatureFlag/Fixed type of PCD at build time.\n\nDynamic customization is preferred for using Patchable/Dynamic type PCD to\ncontrol procedure behavior on the fly.\n\n\nEDK II module developers should consider what logic in the module could be\ngeneralized as early in the development of the module as possible. For example,\nif some functionality had been implemented in a library class of a core\npackage, the developer should replace it by using the library class.\nIf a segment of logic can be extracted as common logic and shared by various\nmodules, the developer can create a new library class and instance.\n\nNote: In the EDK II module development, developers are strongly discouraged\nfrom using a conditional macro to control procedure behavior. The PCD mechanism\nprovides a unified interface, and developers should use it to configure a\nmodule's behavior.\n\n1.1.4 Build Infrastructure\nThe EDK II build system is based on Python and portable C code to provide\ncrossplatform build-ability. Figure 1, developer illustrates the conceptual\nworkflow of the EDK II build system infrastructure.\n4BThe Basics of EDK II\n\nFigure 1 Conceptual workflow\nIn brief, the EDK II build tool parses the metadata files (DSC, DECs, and\nINFs) to generate corresponding one top-level makefile and a separate set of\nmakefile and autogen.c/autogen.h files for every module.\nIn the autogen files, the EDK II build tool generates all definitions of guids,\nprotocols, ppis, and PCDs used by the module, and automatically invokes all of\nthe constructors of used library instances in the module's entry point\nimplementations.\n"},"1_the_basics_of_edk_ii/12_related_references.html":{"url":"1_the_basics_of_edk_ii/12_related_references.html","title":"1.2 Related References","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Each Package is an EDK II distribution unit. It can be\nused to manage and release the big project to facilitate a user's distribution\nand reuse. Entire project sources can be split into different packages to\nreduce the release granularity. The new project can also be made from released\npackages from different sources.\n2.1.1 EDK II Packages\nA Package is a directory that organizes a group of modules with a single\npackage declaration file (DEC).\nEDK II provides UEFI and PI compliant packages: MdePkg, MdeModulePkg, etc.\nThe MdePkg contains the complete definitions in EFI1.1, UEFI2.0, UEFI2.1, PI1.0\nSpecifications and all library classes and instances defined in EDK II MDE\n(Module Development Environment) Library Specification. UEFI and PI drivers can\nbe developed based solely on this package.\nThe MdeModulePkg contains a group of cross-platform drivers that conform to\nUEFI and PI specifications. They can be referred to when developing new UEFI\nand PI drivers.\nDetailed information of EDK II packages can be found in EDK II User Guide,\nsection 2.2 and in the package specification for each package.\n2.1.2 The Package Directory\nEach package has a unified directory structure that separate the different\nsource files. The root directories in each package are: Include, Library,\nApplication and Drivers.\n\nThe include directory contains all public header files that are exposed by\nthis package and are used by this package and other packages. Below the\nInclude directory, subdirectories may be created to include Ppi, Protocol,\nGuid, Industry Standard and library class header files (when these header\nfiles become public).\n\nThe library directory contains directories for each library instance module\nincluded.\n\nThe application directory contains directories for each UEFI applications\nmodule included.\n\nThe driver directory contains directories for each driver group and for each\ndriver.\n\n\nEach module (library instance, application and driver) has its own directory in\nwhich to group its source files. A module may only depend on files under its\ndirectory or on public header files. A module is not permitted to depend on\nsource files from another module directory.\n2.1.2.1 Sample directories and sub-directories in a package\n\nPackage.dec Package declaration file\n\nPackage.dsc Platform Package build description file\n\nInclude Public header files\n\nProtocol\\ Public Protocol header files o Ppi\\ Public PPI header files o\nGuid\\ Public GUID header files\n\nIndustryStandard\\ Public Industry Standard header files o Library\\ Public\nLibrary class header files\n\n\n\nLibrary\\ Libraries instances\n\nNameOneLib\\ Library instance NameOne source files and INF o NameTwoLib\\\nLibrary instance NameTwo source files and INF\n\n\nApplication\\ Uefi Applications o NameOneApp\\ Application NameOne source files\nand INF o NameTwoApp\\ Application NameTwo source files and INF  NameOneDxe\\\nDxe Driver NameOne source files and INF.\n\nNameTwoPei\\ Pei Driver NameTwo source files and INF.\n\n\nIf no related source files exist in a package, the corresponding directory may\nnot be created. For example, if no application is provided in a package, a\nblank Application directory is not required.\n2.1.3 Package Declaration File\nEach package has a single package declaration file (DEC) to define the\npackage's public interfaces. The public interfaces are the package's public\nheader files, GUIDs, and PCDs.\nThe DEC has Defines, Includes, LibraryClasses, Guids, Ppis, Protocols and Pcds\nsections.\nThe [Defines] section defines the package name and package GUID.\nThe [Includes] section must list the root directory of public header file\ndirectory.\nThe [LibraryClasses] section contains every library class header file in the\nPackage\\Include\\Library directory.\nThe [Guids] section specifies the Guid value for each Guid in the\nPackage\\Include\\Guid directory.\nThe [Ppis] section specifies the Guid value for each PPI in the\nPackage\\Include\\Ppi directory.\nThe [Protocols] section specifies the Guid for each Protocol in the\nPackage\\Include\\Protocol directory.\nThe PCDs are declared in different PCD sections according to their type\n(FeatureFlag, FixedAtBuild, PatchableInModule, Dynamic, and DynamicEx). If a\nPCD supports multiple PCD types, it must be declared in all supported type\nsections. When a PCD is declared, its data type and default value must also be\nspecified.\nThe following is a sample DEC file, additional package public information may\nbe added.\n2.1.3.1 Example: Package.dec\n[Defines]\n  DEC_SPECIFICATION = 0x00010005\n  PACKAGE_NAME      = PackageName\n  PACKAGE_GUID      = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n  PACKAGE_VERSION   = 0.1\n\n[Includes]\n  Include #Package Include directory\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  ## Library class name is same to library header file name\n  OneClassLib|Include/Library/OneClassLib.h\n\n[Guids]\n\n#GuidCName = {xxxxxxxx,xxxx,xxxx,{xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx}},\n[Ppis]\n\n#PpiGuidCName = {xxxxxxxx,xxxx,xxxx,{xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx}},\n[Protocols]\n\n#ProtocolGuidCName = {xxxxxxxx,xxxx,xxxx,{xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx,xx}},\n[PcdsFeatureFlag] #FeatureFlag PCD is BOOLEAN type, the value is TRUR or FALSE.\n\n#PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|TRUE|BOOLEAN|TokenNumber\n#PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|FALSE|BOOLEAN|TokenNumber\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild]\n\n#PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|DefaultValue|DataType|TokenNumber\n[PcdsPatchableInModule]\n\n#PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|DefaultValue|DataType|TokenNumber\n[PcdsDynamic]\n\n#PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|DefaultValue|DataType|TokenNumber\n[PcdsDynamicEx]\n  #PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|DefaultValue|DataType|TokenNumber\n\nRefer to the EDK II DEC File Specification for a detailed description of the\nDEC file format.\n2.1.4 Package DSC File\nEach package usually creates another build description file (DSC). All modules\ncan be added into DSC to be compiled and verified. DSC has the following\nsections:\n\nDefines\n\nLibraryClass\n\nPCD\n\nComponents.\n\n\nThe [Defines] section sets build related information, such as the build output\ndirectory, build target, Guid, and build ARCHs.\nThe [Components] section lists all modules (Drivers, Application, and Library\nInstances) in the platform.\nThe [LibraryClasses] section specifies the chosen library instance for every\nlibrary class, which is consumed by the drivers and applications in the\n[Components] section.\nThe [PCDs] section configures PCD type and value for those PCDs used by the\nmodules in the [Components] section. If the PCD value is same as the default\nvalue in DEC, and the PCD type has no specific requirement, the PCD may not be\nconfigured in the DSC. Its value and type will be the default setting in DEC.\nIf all PCDs are not required in the DSC file, the [PCDs] section may be not\ncreated.\n\nNote: Only the DSC file for the active platform is used in a build.\n\nThe following is a sample DSC file.

Following are\nthe recommended rules for defining the new package:\n\nAll modules related to the same functionality should go in the same package.\nFor example, different packages should be created for different chipsets.\n\nGeneric modules shared between different platforms should be in another\npackage. For example, the MdePkg and MdeModulePkg are shared.\n\nModules should go in packages according to their release requirements. If\nmodules are released only to specific customers, they should go in specific\npackages.\n\n\n\nNote: There is no limitation for source files in a new package. Even if\nonly one file is in a package, this package will be valid.\n\nAccording to the rules given immediately above, the EDK II project provides\nseveral packages for user reference.\nWhen a new package is added, the following steps are used to create it.\n\nGive the meaningful package name as the package directory name and create a\npackage directory, such PackageNamePkg.\n\nCreate package DEC and DSC files in the package root directory to describe\nthis package.\n\nCreate package sub-directories to contain the different source files.\n\n\n2.2.2 Using a Package\nA package provides public header files, library classes, PCDs and modules,\nwhich are required to develop other modules and platforms.\nA module is dependent on the package that it resides in and may be dependent on\nother packages.\nA platform is made from the modules contained in its own package, and from\nother packages.\nThe EDK II package is the basic development unit. It can be used to configure\nthe development workspace. According to development requirements, the workspace\ncan integrate different packages from the EDK II project and other sources. To\ndevelop a module or a platform, their dependent packages need to be integrated\ninto the workspace. For example, to develop UEFI and PI driver, the MdePkg,\nwhich contains all UEFI/PI definitions, is required in the workspace.\nThe following show how to develop modules and platforms based on packages.\n\nEach package DEC file and Include directory lists package public header\nfiles, library classes and PCDs. When a new module is developed, it can\ninclude information from the DECs of all packages in current workspaces If it\nneeds information from a package that is not in the current workspace, this\npackage needs to be added.\n\nEach package DSC file lists all modules provided by this package. The\ndeveloper can search the DSCs of all packages in the current workspace to\nobtain the required modules (and move their information into the platform DSC\nfile). Then it specifies those modules in the platform DSC and FDF file. If a\nnew platform still requires the modules from a packages that are not in the\ncurrent workspace, this package needs to be added.\n\n\n2.2.3 Updating a Package\nThe package DEC and DSC files describe the package capability, which should be\ncreated according to source files of this package. If source files are changed,\nremoved, or added, the package DEC and DSC file must be updated to match their\nchange.\nAll changes to source code that affect the DEC and DSC file are introduced one\nby one.\n2.2.3.1 Updating Package Include Directories\nWhen a package Include directory is changed, added, or removed, the [Includes]\na section of the DEC must be updated.\n2.2.3.1.1 Example: Include section of Package.dec\n[Includes]\n  Include # Package Include path\n  LocalInclude # Add new include path\n\n2.2.3.2 Updating Guids/Ppis/Protocols\nWhen a Guid value or Guid global CName defined in the package public Guid\nheader file changes, the [Guids] section of the DEC must be updated to the new\nGuid value or Guid CName. If a public Guid header file is removed, the Guid\ndefined in this file must be removed from the [Guids] section of the DEC. If a\nnew guid header file is added in the package public include directory, the new\ndeclared Guid and its value must be added to the [Guids] section of the DEC.\nLike the Guid header file, any change to Guid values defined in the Ppi and\nProtocol header files also requires the [Ppis] or the [Protocols] section to be\nupdated.\n2.2.3.2.1 Example: Guid section of Package.dec\n[Guids]\n  #gGuidCName = {00000000,0000,0000,{00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00}}\n  #updated to\n  gNewGuidCName = {00000000,0000,0000,{00,00,00,00,00,00,00,01}}\n\n2.2.3.3 Updating Library Classes\nWhen the library class name is changed, the library class header file name\nneeds to update the [LibraryClasses] section of the DEC to map the new library\nclass name to the (new?) header file. The change to the library class name will\nalso require the [LibraryClasses] section (of the DSC to be updated) to map the\nnew library class name and the library instance. When a new library class is\nintroduced, its name and its header file will be specified in the DEC\n[LibraryClasses] section.\n2.2.3.3.1 Example: LibraryClasses section of Package.dsc\n[LibraryClasses]\n  #OneClassLib|Include/Library/OneClassLib.inf updated to\n  BaseMemoryLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLib/BaseMemoryLib.inf\n\n2.2.3.4 Updating PCDs\nPCDs are declared in the package DEC and are not related to any header file.\nHowever, module source files use them. If a PCD does not exist in any module,\nits declaration should be removed from the DEC file. The setting for this PCD\nin DSC file should also be removed.\nWhen a module requires a new PCD, it needs to define this PCD in the DEC file\nfor the package where the module is located. Then the DEC file will specify the\nPCD type and default value.\n2.2.3.4.1 Example: Package.dec\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild]\n  #Add new FixedAtBuild PCD\n  #PcdTokenSpaceCGuidName.PcdName|DefaultValue|DataType|TokenNumber\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldTimes|1|UINT32|0x40000005\n\n2.2.3.5 Updating Modules\nChanges to modules (Library instance, drivers and applications) cause the\ndependent header file, library class and PCDs be modified, which requires the\nDSC file to be updated.\nIf a module INF file name is changed, the DSC files that refer to this module\nare updated to new file name. If a module is completely removed, it will not be\ncompiled any more, and is removed from the package DSC. When a new module is\nadded to a package, it should be added to the package DSC to be compiled and\nverified.\n2.2.3.5.1 Example: Package.dsc\n[Components] #Module INF file path are specified from package directory.\n  # PackageNamePkg/NameTwoPei/NameTwoDxe.inf\n  # updated to\n  MdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.inf\n\n"},"3_module_development/":{"url":"3_module_development/","title":"3 Module Development","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

An INF file describes a module's basic information\nand interfaces such as consumed/produced library class/PCD/Protocol/Ppi/Guid.\n(Please refer to the EDK II Extended INF Specification\nA typical EDK II module is a firmware component that is built, put in an FFS\nfile and then put into a FV image. The component may be:\n A driver or application which is built to *.efi binary file and put into FFS\nfile as EFI_PE_SECTION:\n \n\n\n\nFigure 2 Firmware Volume\n\nRaw data binary. For example, $(WORKSPACE)\\MdeModulePkg\\Logo\\Logo.inf is a\nraw binary module which contains logo bitmap image.\n\nAn option ROM driver that is put into a device's option ROM.\n\nA standalone UEFI driver\n\nA standalone UEFI application.\n\nA library instance that is built to a library object file (.lib) and\nstatically linked to another module.\n\n\n\nNote: A module can be released in source code or in EFI binary format.\n\n3.1.1 Module Type\nEDK II defines many module types. The module type is used to:\n\nIndicate the lifecycle for different types of modules. For example, PEIM is\ndispatched in PEI phase and DXE_DRIVER orUEFI_DRIVER is dispatched at DXE\nphase;\n\nIndicate the binary image generation for different types of modules. For\nexample, a PEIM/DXE_DRIVER type module can have \"depex\" section in .efi\nbinary image; a UEFI_DRIVER can have .ui or .ver section in .efi binary image;\n\nIndicate EntryPoint() or Constructor() API for different types of modules.\n\nIndicate the suitable library instance for different types of modules. A\nlibrary instance will point out what module types are supported in INF file.\n\n\nTable 1 EDK II Module Types\n\n\n\nMODULE_TYPE\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSEC\nModules of this type are designed to start execution at the reset vector of a CPU. They are responsible for preparing the platform for the PEI Phase. Since there are no standard services defined for SEC, modules of this type follow the same rules as modules of type Base and typically include some amount of CPU specific assembly code to establish temporary memory for a stack. Modules of this type may optionally produce services that are passed to the PEI Phase in HOBs and those services must be compliant with the PI specification.\n\n\nPEI_CORE\nThis module type is used by PEI Core implementations that are complaint with the PI specification.\n\n\nPEIM\nThis module type is used by PEIMs that are compliant with the PI specification.\n\n\nDXE_CORE\nThis module type is used by DXE Core implementations that are compliant with the PI specification.\n\n\nDXE_DRIVER\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are complaint with the PI specification. These modules only execute in the\n\n\n\nboot services environment and are destroyed when ExitBootServices() is called.\n\n\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are complaint with the PI specification. These modules execute in both boot services and runtime services environments. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices() is called. If SetVirtualAddressMap() is called, then modules of this type are relocated according to virtual address map provided by the operating system.\n\n\nDXE_SAL_DRIVER\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that can be called in physical mode before SetVirtualAddressMap() is called and either physical mode or virtual mode after\n\n\n\nSetVirtualAddressMap() is called. This module type is only available to IPF CPUs. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are loaded into\n\n\n\nSMRAM. As a result, this module type is only available for IA32 and x64 CPUs. These modules only execute in physical mode, and are never destroyed. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nUEFI_DRIVER\nThis module type is used by UEFI Drivers that are compliant with the UEFI Specification. These modules provide services in the boot services execution environment. UEFI Drivers that return EFI_SUCCESS are not unloaded from memory. UEFI Drivers that return an error are unloaded from memory.\n\n\nUEFI_APPLICATION\nThis module type is used by UEFI Applications that are compliant with the UEFI Specification. UEFI Applications are always unloaded when they exit.\n\n\n\n"},"3_module_development/32_creating_a_module.html":{"url":"3_module_development/32_creating_a_module.html","title":"3.2 Creating a Module","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The\n\"similar\" is recommended to be determined by following rules:\nIndustry standard\nFor example, MdePkg package contains the definitions from PIWG, UEFI, SMBIOS,\nUSB, PCI, etc, which are all industry standards.\nSimilar technology\nFor example, OptionRomPkg groups the definitions and modules related to Option\nRom technology.\nBusiness reason\nFor example, IntelFrameworkPkg groups the definitions and modules for Intel\nframework implementation.\nPlatform\nFor example, Nt32Pkg groups the definitions and modules required by Nt32\nplatform. In addition, a platform package also will provide a DSC and FDF file\nfor platform building.\nAt the beginning of developing a module, the module developers need to consider\nthe purpose and release process for the module to select the appropriate\npackage.\n\nNote: The packages in\nhttps://edk2.tianocore.org are basic core\npackages.\n\nGenerally, a new module should not be created in them.\n3.2.1.2 Adding a Module Directory\nA module directory should be added to the proper package with the following\nrecommendations:\n\nPut a library module to \"/Library\" directory.\n\nPut PROTOCOL, PPI, GUID, or Library Class definitions in \"/Include/Protocol\" or \"/Include/Ppi\" or \"/Include/Guid\" or \"/Include/Library\" directory respectively.\n\nPut a driver module in \"\" directory.\n\nPut an application module in \"/Application\" directory \nUse recommend directory name for module as follows:\n\n\nTable 2 Recommended name convention for module directory\n\n\n\nRecommended directory name convention\nModule Type\n\n\n\n\nXxxPei\nPEIM, PEI_CORE\n\n\nXxxDxe\nDXE_DRIVER, UEFI_DRIVER\n\n\nXxxRuntimeDxe\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER\n\n\nXxxxDxeSal\nDXE_SAL_DRIVER\n\n\nXxxxLib\nLibrary Instance\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Sample: Module Meta File - INF\nEach module requires a module INF file in the root directory of the module.\nA module is INF file (sometimes referred to as the module meta-file) includes\nthe following items:\n\nThe module's basic information, such as name, GUID, module type, etc.\n\nThe path to any packages the module is dependent on.\n\nThe path to binary files or source files included in the module.\n\nA list of all interfaces required by the module, i.e. Protocol, Ppi, Guid.\n\nA list of all PCDs and Library classes required by the module.\n\nOthers, such as dependency section depending on the module type.\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Example: Application Module INF\n##\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION                = 0x00010005\n  BASE_NAME                  = HelloWorld\n  FILE_GUID                  = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  MODULE_TYPE                = UEFI_APPLICATION\n  VERSION_STRING             = 1.0\n  UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION = 0x0002001E\n  ENTRY_POINT                = UefiMain\n\n#\n# The following information is for reference only and not required by the\n# build tools.\n#\n# VALID_ARCHITECTURES = IA32 X64 IPF EBC\n#\n##\n[Sources.common]\n  HelloWorld.c\n\n##\n[Packages]\n  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec\n\n##\n[LibraryClasses]\n  UefiBootServicesTableLib\n  UefiApplicationEntryPoint\n  UefiLib\n  DebugLib\n\n3.2.2.2 Example: Library Module INF\nFollowing is a sample INF file for PeiSevicesTablePointerLib.inf library\ninstance:\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION    = 0x00010005\n  BASE_NAME      = PeiServicesTablePointerLib\n  FILE_GUID      = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  MODULE_TYPE    = PEIM\n  VERSION_STRING = 1.0\n  LIBRARY_CLASS  = PeiServicesTablePointerLib|PEIM\n  PEI_CORE SEC\n  CONSTRUCTOR    = PeiServicesTablePointerLibConstructor\n\n#\n# VALID_ARCHITECTURES = IA32 X64 IPF EBC (EBC is for build\n#only)\n#\n[Sources.common]\n  PeiServicesTablePointer.c\n\n[Packages]\n  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  DebugLib\n\nNote: if the library supports the cross module types PEIM, UEFI_DIRVER, DXE_DRIVER.\nIts module type can be PEIM or UEFI_DRIVER or DXE_DRIVER. If it has the library\nconstructor, its module type must be BASE. BASE type library constructor has no\ninput parameter that can link to any driver type.\n3.2.3 Adding a Package Dependency\nThe [Packages] section of the INF file describes all packages dependencies of\nthis module. The EDK II relative path of dependent package DEC file is\ndescribed in INF's [Packages] section as follows:\n[Packages]\n  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec\n  IntelFrameworkPkg/IntelFrameworkPkg.dec\n\n\nNote: The path is from the root of the $workspace, not from the module\ndirectory.\n\nA module should use the following rules for determining package dependency:\n\nThe MdePkg package is required for all modules\n\nIf using definitions from Intel framework specification, dependency on the\nIntelFrameworkPkg is required.\n\nBeyond the preceding rules, more package dependencies are introduced by\nreferencing or using surface items, such as Protocol, Ppi, Guid, PCD, Library\nClass, etc. For example, if a module uses definitions or interfaces from the\nlibrary class \"HiiLib\" that is defined in MdeModulePkg package, it would need\nto be dependent on the MdeModulePkg.\n\n\n3.2.4 Adding Source Files\nAll module source code is described in the INF [sources] section, and is based\non following rules:\n\nNote: The UNIX-style path separator \"/\" should be used, not the\nWindows*-style \"\\\".\n\n Different architecture sources are put in different source sections.\n[Sources.common] # source in this section is suitable for all arch\n  CheckSum.c ...\n\n[Sources.Ia32] # source in this section is suitable for IA32 arch\n  Ia32/Wbinvd.c | MSFT ...\n  Ia32/WriteMm7.S | GCC ...\n\n[Sources.X64] # source in this section is suitable for X64 arch X64/Thunk16.asm ...\n\n[Sources.IPF] # source in this section is suitable for IPF arch Ipf/AsmCpuMisc.s ...\n\n[Sources.EBC] # source in this section is suitable for EBC arch Synchronization.c ...\n\n\nTool Tags are used describe the sources for different tool chains.\n\n[Sources.Ia32]\n  Ia32/Wbinvd.c | MSFT # source is built when MSFT tool is used ...\n  Ia32/WriteMm7.S | GCC # source is built when GCC tool is used ...\n  \"$(CC)\" -o ${dst} $(CC_FLAGS) $(INC) ${src}\n\n\nAll files should be put under the module's main folder. Do not use \". /\" \nAll C include files should also be listed in the sources section.\n\n3.2.4.1 Supported Tool Tag\nThe following tool tag name is supported by edk2.\nTable 3 EDK II supported file extensions\n\n\n\nTool Tag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMSFT\nMicrosoft Family Tool Chain\n\n\nINTEL\nINTEL Tool Chain\n\n\nGCC\nGCC Tool Chain\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Add Library Class References\nThe library class abstracts some macro or structure definitions and function\ndeclarations. The library instance, which is the implementation of a given\nlibrary class, can be different for different platform or for different phases\n(SEC ,PEI, DXE) in one platform. Therefore, a module will be dependent on a\nlibrary class for platform or phase specific behavior.\nThe steps of using a library class in a module are:\n\nAdd a dependency for the package containing the library class in INF file\n\nAdd a dependency for the library class in the INF file\n\nInclude the library class header file in source code.\n\n\nTo include the library class header in C source code use the following syntax:\n#include \nThe header including path is relative to the package's public include path,\nwhich is defined in the package (containing the library class, not necessarily\nthe module) DEC's [include] section.\n\nNote: Rememberr to use \"/\" for the path separator.\n\n3.2.6 Adding PCD References\nMACRO and global variables are widely used to make modules customizable in\ndifferent architectures and different platforms. The EDK II introduces the PCD\nconcept to replace these methods. For example, a \"FeatureFlag\" type PCD is\nsimilar to a project MACRO in that some feature or functionality will be\nenabled if the PCD's value is TRUE, and vice versa.\nA PCD entry is defined by the PCD's Token Space Guid C name, followed by a\nperiod \".\" character and the PCD's C name. In one PCD's token space, each PCD's\nC name is unique.\nFor example, for PCD gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel, gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid is the token space name\nand PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel is the PCD name, and gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid is mapped to a GUID defined in MdePkg :\ngEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid = { 0x914AEBE7, 0x4635, 0x459b, { 0xAA, 0x1C, 0x11, 0xE2, 0x19, 0xB0, 0x3A, 0x10 }}\n\n3.2.6.1 PCD Types\nEDK II provides the following types of PCDs:\nFeature flag type PCD\nThis PCD type replaces a switch MACRO to enable or disable a feature. This is a\nBoolean value, and is either TRUE or FALSE.\nFixed at build type PCD\nThis PCD type replaces a macro that produced a customizable value, such as the\nPCI Express base address. The value of this PCD type is determined at build\ntime and is stored in the code section of a module's PE image.\nPatchable in module type PCD\nThis PCD type is very similar to the fixed at build PCD type, but the value is\nstored in the data section, rather than the code section, of the module's PE\nimage.\nDynamic type PCD\nThis PCD type is different from the other PCD types listed. The value is\nassigned by one module and is accessed by other modules in execution time. The\nPEIM PcdPeim and the DXE Driver PcdDXE each maintain a PCD database that\ncontains all dynamic PCD information used by platform in their respective phase.\n3.2.6.2 Add the Package Dependency\nWhen using a PCD in a module, package dependencies must be added to INF's\n[Packages] section. Two packages are required: the package containing the PCD\nbeing used, and the MdePkg. The MdePkg is required because the library class\n\"PcdLib\" in MdePkg provides PCD accessing functions and macros.\n3.2.6.3 Adding PCDs to module's INF file\nTo reference a PCD entry, the token space guid name and PCD name must be added\ninto the INF's [PCD] section:\n[PCD.common]\n  gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdMaximumLinkedListLength gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdMaximumUnicodeStringLength\n\nWe recommended using a general type \"PCD\" in the module's INF, so that it\nallows platform integrators to choose any PCD type for different usage cases.\nFor example, in a desktop platform, memory length can be designated as a\n\"Dynamic\" PCD, and its value is produced by the memory discovery driver.\nHowever, in some special embedded systems, memory length is designed as a\n\"FixedAtBuild\" type PCD, and its value is always fixed.\nThere are limitations for selecting PCD types:\n If a PCD value is used as constant value such as array's length, this PCD's\ntype should be \"FixedPcd\". For example:\nUINT8 MySampleArray[FixedPcdGet16(PcdArrayLength)] = {0};\n\nNote: Avoid using \"FixedPcd\" in the library instance modules, because the\nlibrary instance can link to different modules, and the same PCD may have a\ndifferent value in different modules.\n\nNote: In a single module, avoid using two PCDs with same name but in\ndifferent token spaces.\n\nTable 4 INF PCD Section Name\n\n\n\nPCD Type\nINF File Section Name\n\n\n\n\nGeneral type that can be mapped in any PCD type\nPCD\n\n\nFeature Flag\nFeaturePcd\n\n\nFixed At Build\nFixedPcd\n\n\nPatchable In Module\nPatchPcd\n\n\nDynamic\nPCD\n\n\n\n3.2.6.4 Accessing a PCD value from C source code\nTo obtain or set a PCD's value from source code, the following steps should be\ntaken:\n\nAdd the dependency for PcdLib to the module INF file.\n\nAdd the dependency for MdePkg.\n\nAdd the include for  in source code.\n\nUse the PcdLib interface to access the PCD's value.\n\n\nTable 5 PCD access functions\n\n\n\nFunction name\nINF PCD Section Name\n\n\n\n\nPcdGetx()/PcdSetx()\nCommon get/set function for all PCDs type\n\n\nFeaturePcdGet()/FeaturePcdSet()\nGet/set function for \"FeaturePcd\"\n\n\nFixedPcdGetx()\nGet function for \"FixedPcd\"\n\n\nPatchPcdGetx()/PatchPcdSetx\nGet/Set function for \"PatchPcd\"\n\n\n\nFor example, the PcdGet32 macro is used to obtain the 32-bit value for all\ntypes of PCDs:\n//\n// Check driver debug mask value and global mask\n//\nif ((ErrorLevel &PcdGet32 (PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel)) == 0)\n{\n  return;\n}\n\n3.2.7 Referencing a Protocol, PPI, or GUID\nA Protocol, PPI, or a Guid is a UEFI architecture interface item and abstract\nfirmware component's interface. This section introduces how to reference one of\nthese interfaces from a module.\n3.2.7.1 Adding Protocol, PPI, or GUID to INF file\nThe name of Protocol, PPI, or GUID must be added into the corresponding section\nin the module INF file: [Protocol], [Ppi], and [Guid]. For example:\n[Protocol] gEfiSampleProtocol\n3.2.7.2 Including the header file in source code\nThe Protocol, PPI, or GUID header file may define related structures. Use the\nfollowing procedure to find the header file path:\n\nThe header file for a Ppi is in \\Include\\Ppi.\n\nThe header file for a Protocol is in \\Include\\Protocol.\n\nThe header file for a Guid is in \\Include\\Guid.\n\n\nHeader files must be explicitly included in the module source code. For example:\n#include \n#include \n#include \n3.2.8 Adding a Dependency to a Module\nThe dependency expression gives the conditions for executing or dispatching a\ndriver's entry point. This helps determine the dispatch order for PEIM and DXE\nmodules.\nAn expression consists of one or more Protocol, PPI, or GUID with operators\nsuch as \"AND\", \"OR\", \"TRUE\", \"FALSE\", \"NOT\" etc.\nThe Platform Initialization Specification gives detailed syntax for PEIM's\ndependency expression in the \"Dependency Expressions\" chapter, and details for\nthe DXE module's dependency expression in the \"Dependency Expression Grammar\"\nchapter.\nThe expression should be put in the INF's depex section as follows:\n[depex]\n\ngEfiSampleGuid AND gEfiSamplePpiGuid\n"},"3_module_development/33_additional_steps_for_library_instances.html":{"url":"3_module_development/33_additional_steps_for_library_instances.html","title":"3.3 Additional Steps for Library Instances","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

For example, the inventorystring.uni defined in MdeModulePkg\\Universal\\DriverSampleDxe is compiled to binary array: extern UINT8 DriverSampleStrings[]; }\n\nModule developers should use the following codes to publish the strings array\nvariable into the HII database:\n//\n// Create HII driver handle, paramter DriverHandle will hold the\n// returned new handle.\n// HiiLibCreateHiiDriverHandle defined in UefiHiiLib library class.\n//\nStatus = HiiLibCreateHiiDriverHandle (&DriverHandle);\n//\n// Prepare HII package list, parameter DriverSampleStrings is the\n// strings binary data.\n// HiiLibPreparePackageList defined in UefiHiiLib library class\n//\nPackageList = HiiLibPreparePackageList (\n                2,\n                &mFormSetGuid,\n                DriverSampleStrings,\n                VfrBin\n                );\nif (PackageList == NULL)\n{\n  return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;\n}\n//\n// Create package into HII database via EFI_HII_PROTOCOL-\n> NewPackageList\n//\nStatus = HiiDatabase->NewPackageList (\n                        HiiDatabase,\n                        PackageList,\n                        DriverHandle[0],\n                        &HiiHandle[0]\n                        );\n\nAs with other types HII resources, if a module publishs the HII data into a PE\nresource section, UEFI_HII_RESOURCE_SECTION is set to TRUE in the module's INF\nfile and the following code is used:\n//\n// Retrieve HII package list from ImageHandle\n//\nStatus = gBS->OpenProtocol (\n                ImageHandle,\n                &gEfiHiiPackageListProtocolGuid,\n                (VOID **) &PackageList,\n                ImageHandle,\n                NULL,\n                EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_GET_PROTOCOL\n                );\nif (EFI_ERROR (Status))\n{\n  return Status;\n}\n//\n// Publish sample Fromset\n//\nStatus = gBS->InstallProtocolInterface (\n                &mDriverHandle,\n                &gEfiDevicePathProtocolGuid,\n                EFI_NATIVE_INTERFACE,\n                &mHiiVendorDevicePath\n                );\nif (EFI_ERROR (Status))\n{\n  return Status;\n}\n//\n// Publish HII package list to HII Database.\n//\nStatus = gHiiDatabase->NewPackageList (\n                         gHiiDatabase,\n                         PackageList,\n                         mDriverHandle,\n                         &mHiiHandle\n                         );\nif (EFI_ERROR (Status))\n{\n  return Status;\n}\n\n"},"3_module_development/37_building_the_module.html":{"url":"3_module_development/37_building_the_module.html","title":"3.7 Building the module","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Library, EFI and OptionRom images are\nsupported by the EDK II build system.\n3.7.1 Add the module INF in package DSC\nTo build a module, the module INF file is specified in DSC [Components]\nsection. Its relative file path from the workspace (beginning from the package\ndirectory), up to and including the INF file name, is added per the following\nexample. Some module may be required to be built for the specific ARCH.\nThe DSC [Defines] section lists all supported architectures for this platform.\nThe [Components.ARCH] section lists the modules for this architecture. The ARCH\nmust be on the list of all ARCHs from the [Defines] section. The separate\n[Components] section can be created for the modules that support the different\narchitectures.\n3.7.1.1 Example: Package.dsc Components\n[Defines]\n  ......\n  SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES = IA32|IPF|X64|EBC\n  ......\n\n[Components] ## All libraries, drivers and applications may be added here to be built.\n  ## this library will be built to the IA32, IPF, X64 and EBC arch version.\n  PackageNamePkg/Library/NameOneLib/NameOneLib.inf\n\n[Components.IA32] ## This PEI driver will be built to the IA32 arch version.\n  PackageNamePkg/NameTwoPei/NameTwoPei.inf\n\n[Components.X64, Components.EBC] ## This DXE driver will be built to the X64 and EBC arch version.\n  PackageNamePkg/NameOneDxe/NameOneDxe.inf\n\n3.7.2 Select Library Instances\n\nNote: Skip this step if the module is a library instance.\n\nFor drivers and applications, a library instance for each library class\ndependency must be selected and linked to its binary EFI image.\nThe module INF [LibraryClasses] section lists all required library classes,\nwhich are produced by library instances.\nLibrary instances are implemented for the different purposes. Most of them\nabstract the generic logic as the common interfaces for the crossing platform\nmodules. Some are for performance and size optimization.\nFor example, in the MdePkg the BaseMemoryLibOptDxe instances produce the \"good\nperformance\" BaseMemory library class implementation based on the registers to\nperform a memory operation. Another example, in the MdePkg the PeiIoLibCpuIo\nlibrary instance implements the Io library class by using the services of CpuIo\nPPI to reduce code size.\nDepending on platform requirements, different library instances can be set in\nthe DSC [LibraryClasses] section. In the initial development, the generic\nlibrary instances without any optimization are often used to reduce the\ndevelopment risk. After the module basic functionality is finished, it can be\nfurther tuned for size and performance.\nThe EDK II MdePkg provides many common library instances for user selection.\nThe details for each library instance are found in its INF file or in the\nMdePkg specification.\nThe following example lists the most basic library instances.\n3.7.2.1 Example Package.dsc LibraryClasses\n3.7.2.1.1 Example 1: Generic library instances\n[LibraryClasses]\n  ## Basic Library\n  BaseLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseLib/BaseLib.inf\n  DebugLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseDebugLibNull/BaseDebugLibNull.inf\n  SynchronizationLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseSynchronizationLib/BaseSynchronizat ionLib.inf\n  CpuLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseCpuLib/BaseCpuLib.inf\n  BaseMemoryLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLib/BaseMemoryLib.inf\n  PrintLib|MdePkg/Library/BasePrintLib/BasePrintLib.inf\n  PcdLib|MdePkg/Library/BasePcdLibNull/BasePcdLibNull.inf\n  ## Pci Library\n  PciCf8Lib|MdePkg/Library/BasePciCf8Lib/BasePciCf8Lib.inf\n  PciExpressLib|MdePkg/Library/BasePciExpressLib/BasePciExpressLib.inf\n  PciLib|MdePkg/Library/BasePciLibCf8/BasePciLibCf8.inf\n  ## Entry Point Library\n  PeimEntryPoint|MdePkg/Library/PeimEntryPoint/PeimEntryPoint.inf\n  UefiDriverEntryPoint|MdePkg/Library/UefiDriverEntryPoint/UefiDriverEntryP oint.inf\n  UefiApplicationEntryPoint|MdePkg/Library/UefiApplicationEntryPoint/UefiAp plicationEntryPoint.inf\n  ## PEI service library\n  PeiServicesLib|MdePkg/Library/PeiServicesLib/PeiServicesLib.inf\n  PeiServicesTablePointerLib|MdePkg/Library/PeiServicesTablePointerLib/PeiS ervicesTablePointerLib.inf\n  ## UEFI and DXE service library\n  UefiBootServicesTableLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib/UefiBoot\n  ServicesTableLib.inf\n  DxeServicesTableLib|MdePkg/Library/DxeServicesTableLib/DxeServicesTableLi b.inf\n  UefiRuntimeServicesTableLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiRuntimeServicesTableLib/Ue fiRuntimeServicesTableLib.inf\n  DxeServicesLib|MdePkg/Library/DxeServicesLib/DxeServicesLib.inf\n  UefiRuntimeLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiRuntimeLib/UefiRuntimeLib.inf\n  UefiLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/UefiLib.inf\n  DevicePathLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiDevicePathLib/UefiDevicePathLib.inf\n  ## This library instance should be provide by chipset.\n  TimerLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate\n  .inf\n\nThe library instances given above are generic ones for use in all drivers.\nHowever, according to the module type and CPU architecture, more suitable\nlibrary instances can be added into [LibraryClass.ARCHs.ModuleType] section to\noverride the common setting, per the following example:\n3.7.2.1.2 Example 2: library instances per module type and CPU architecture\n[Defines]\n  ......\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  ......\n\n[LibraryClasses.IA32, LibraryClasses.X64]\n  ## these two optimized library istances only for X86 arch.\n  ## they will override the above common base memory instance.\n  MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLibOptDxe/BaseMemoryLibOptDxe.inf\n  MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLibOptPei/BaseMemoryLibOptPei.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.common.UEFI_DRIVER]\n  # these two library intances are set for UEFI driver type module.\n  #\n  # Debug library instance will override the above NULL instance.\n  MemoryAllocationLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiMemoryAllocationLib/UefiMemoryAllo cationLib.inf DebugLib|MdePkg/Library/UefiDebugLibConOut/UefiDebugLibConOut.inf\n\nFor the specific requirement, a driver may select its library instances to\noverride all library instances specified in the [LibraryClasses] section. This\nchosen library instance is set only for this driver. Such usage is also\nsupported in the DSC as follows:\n3.7.2.1.3 Example 3: library instances for a specific driver\n[Defines]\n  ......\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  ......\n\n[Components]\n  ## For NameOnDxe driver, its linked PCD library instance is DxePcdLib, not\n  ## the above BasePcdLibNull instance.\n  PackageNamePkg/NameOneDxe/NameOneDxe.inf {\n  \n  PcdLib|MdePkg/Library/DxePcdLib/DxePcdLib.inf\n  }\n\n3.7.3 Configure PCDs\n\nNote: Skip this step for library modules\n\nModules that consume PCDs (including those consumed by linked libraries) need\nto have those PCDs configured in the DSC. The configured PCDs will be applied\nboth to the module and to its linked library instances. PCDs are declared in\npackage DEC file. When the PCD's value is the same as the default value defined\nin the DEC, those PCDs need not be specified in DSC again.\nIn the DSC, the PCD type and value can be configured according to the platform\nrequirements. The PCD type must be set to single type in a DSC file. If not\nspecified in DSC, the PCD type will be same as its declaration PCD type in the\npackage DEC file. If a PCD is declared to support multiple PCD types, the\ndefault PCD type is a fixed PCD.\nThe PCD value may set the different values for the different drivers. If its\nvalue is not specified, the value will be from its declaration default value to\nthe chosen PCD type in the package DEC file.\n3.7.3.1 PCD types\n\nPcdsFeatureFlag,\n\nPcdsFixedAtBuild,  PcdsPatchableInModule,  PcdsDynamic.\n\n\n3.7.3.2 Feature Flag PCD\nIf a PCD is declared as PcdsFeatureFlag, it must be of the FeatureFlag PCD type\nand BOOLEAN data type. When this type of PCD is used in a module, it must be\nspecified in the [FeaturePcd] section of the module INF.\n\nNote: Only FeaturePcdGet API can access this PCD type.\n\n3.7.3.3 Fixed PCD\nIf a PCD value is decided during the build time, its type can be set to\nPcdsFixedAtBuild. When this PCD type is used in module, it can be specified in\nthe [FixedPcd] or [PCD] section of the module INF. In addition, FixedPcdGet and\nPcdGet API can be used to access this type PCD in the module source code.\nWhen FixedPcdGet API is used, this type PCD can be used as the array index in a\ndriver.\n\nNote: For a library, no such usage is supported.\n\n3.7.3.4 Patchable PCD\nIf the PCD value needs to be modified in the binary image, its type will be\nPcdsPatchableInModule. When this type PCD is used in module, it can be\nspecified in the [FatchPcd] or [PCD] section of the module INF. In addition,\nPatchPcdGet/PatchPcdSet and PcdGet/PcdSet API can be used to access this type\nPCD in the module source code.\n3.7.3.5 Dynamic PCD\nIf PCD value is obtained from the runtime environment, its type must be\nDynamic. If a dynamic PCD is from a PCD database that shares data between\ndrives, its type will be PcdsDynamicDefault. If a dynamic PCD is related to a\nUEFI variable, its type will be PcdsDynamicHII.\nWhen this type PCD is used in a module, it must be specified in the [PCD]\nsection of the module INF. Only PcdGet/PcdSet API can be used to access this\ntype PCD in module source code.\nDynamic type PCDs must be configured in the DSC file to set the dynamic type\nand the initial value for the whole platform, which cannot inherit from its\ndeclaration DEC file and cannot be overridden by a driver.\nThe following example gives each type of PCD setting:\n3.7.3.5.1 Package.dsc PCDs showing each type of PCD setting\n[PcdsFeatureFlag]\n  #PcdName | Pcdvalue\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintEnable|TRUE\n\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild]\n  #StringPcdName | StringValue| StringType| StringMaxSize\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintString |L\"UEFI Hello\n  World!n\"|VOID*|100\n\n[PcdsPatchableInModule]\n  #Pring level can be modifed in binary image\n  gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|0x80000046\n\n[PcdsDynamicDefault]\n  #Default print times is 1, its can be modifed in runtime.\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintTimes|0x1\n\n[PcdsDynamicHii]\n  #time out\n  #PcdName | Uefi Variable name | Uefi Variable Guid | Offset | Default value\n  gEfiIntelFrameworkModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPlatformBootTimeOut|L\"Timeou t\"|gEfiGlobalVariableGuid|0x0|5\n\nPCD section also supports ARCH option to set PCDs value only for a specific\nARCH image. It can be set in [PcdsType.ARCHs] section. For example:\n3.7.3.5.2 Example: Package.dsc PCDs for a specific ARCH image\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.IPF]\ngEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdIoBlockBaseAddressForIpf|0x0ffffc000000\n\nPCD value can be also set only for a driver to override the PCD section\nsetting. However, Dynamic type PCD must be set as the global value, which\ncannot be overridden by a driver. Such usage is also supported in DSC like:\n3.7.3.5.3 Example: Package.dsc dynamic PCDs\n[Components]\n  # For NameOnDxe driver, its print level PCD value is 0x80000000, not same to\n  # the above setting 0x80000046.\n  PackageNamePkg/NameOneDxe/NameOneDxe.inf {\n  \n  gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|0x80000000 }\n\n3.7.4 Customize Build Options\nBuild options are the different compiler options to build the image under the\ndifferent tool chain. They are defined in $(WORKSPACE)/Conf/toolsdef.txt file.\nThis file provides the common compiler options for each tool chain tag. The\ncompiler options are grouped into two main types: compile option and link\noption. The full option list can refer to tools_def.txt and _EDK II Build\nSpecification.\nThe following example lists the usual compiler and link option.\n3.7.4.1 Example: Tools_def.txt\nWhen the common build options in tools_def.txt do not satisfy the development\nrequirement, they can be extended or replaced.\n  #\n  # Build option syntax\n  # TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_ARCH_COMMANDTYPE_ATTRIBUTE = build option\n  #\n  # TARGET is RELEASE or DEBUG\n  # TOOLCHAIN is tool tag name, MYTOOLS is a tag with VS2005 tool chain\n  # ARCH is the tool cpu family architecture.\n  # COMMANDTYPE is the build option name. CC is compile, DLINK is link.\n  # ATTRIBUTE is FLAGS for the build option.\n  #\n  # Debug related options of VS2005 compiler\n  DEBUG_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS    = ... /Zi /Gm\n  DEBUG_MYTOOLS_IA32_DLINK_FLAGS = ... /DEBUG\n\nThe EDK II build system provides four levels of override mechanisms to\ncustomize the compiler options. The options override each other in the order\ngiven.\n3.7.4.2 Modifying Tools_def.txt\nDirectly modify build options in tool_def.txt, which changes the compiler\noptions and affects all modules and platforms in same workspace.\n3.7.4.3 Modifying an INF file\nAdd the additional compiler option in module INF [BuildOptions], which applies\nfor this module to be built in any build DSC.\n3.7.4.3.1 Example: Module.inf\n[BuildOptions]\n  #\n  # Tool Chain Family: MSFT, INTEL, GCC for the different compiler tools.\n  # The different compiler tools have the different compiler options.\n  # * is not specific TARGET, TOOLTAGNAME, ARCHs.\n  #\n  # '=' append the additional option to the tail.\n  # Append /FAsc compile option only for this module\n  #\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /FAsc\n  #\n  # '==' replace all options by using new setting\n  #\n  MSFT:*_*_*_DLINK_FLAGS = = /DEBUG\n\n3.7.4.4 Modifying DSC platform options\nAdd the additional compiler option in build DSC [BuildOptions] section, which\nwill update the compiler options for all modules described in same DSC.\n3.7.4.4.1 Example: Package.dsc BuildOptions -compler options for all modules\n[BuildOptions]\n  #\n  # Append /Od Compile option in DSC to disable optimiaztion for all modules\n  #\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /Od\n\n3.7.4.5 Modifying a DSC for a single module\nAdd the additional compiler option in the build DSC [Components] section for a\nmodule, which applies for it only in this build DSC.\n3.7.4.5.1 Example: Package.dsc BuildOptions-single module compiler options\n[Components]\n  #\n  # Append the debug compile option only to NameOneDxe driver\n  #\n  PackageNamePkg/NameOneDxe/NameOneDxe.inf {\n  \n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /Od\n  }\n\nThe higher-level setting will append new options in the tail or replace all\noptions. The four methods work together meet the platform build requirements.\n\nNote: The last two usages are recommended. Both only modify the DSC file.\n\n3.7.5 Build module image\nAfter the settings given above, the EDK II build command can be called to build\nthe module to the binary image. It has many build configurations to support the\ndiffering build requirements. The usual used build options are introduced in\nthe following manner:\n3.7.5.1 Example: Build option\nBuild -p Package.dsc -m Module.inf -a ARCH -b TARGET -t TOOLTAG\n3.7.5.2 Build Package (-p option)\nAll modules in the [Components] section of the specified package DSC will be\nbuilt if the build module option is not added. If specified more than once on\nthe command line, the final selection is used.\n3.7.5.2.1 Example: Build -p option\n  # Build all modules in PackageOne DSC\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc\n  # Build all modules in PackageTwo DSC\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -p PackageTwoPackageTwo.dsc\n\n3.7.5.3 Build Module (-m option)\nWhen a single specified module is built, it must be in the [Components] section\nof the specified DSC. If this option is not added, all modules in the DSC will\nbe built. If specified more than once on the command line, the final selection\nis used.\n3.7.5.3.1 Example: Build -m option\n  # Build single module One in PacakgeOne DSC\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -m PackageOneOneOne.inf\n  # Build single module Two in PackageOne DSC\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -m PackageOneOneOne.inf -m\n  PackageOneTwoTwo.inf\n\n3.7.5.4 Build ARCH (-a option)\nThe supported ARCH option is IA32, X64, IPF and EBC. New arch types may be\nadded in the future. The module with the settings given above will be built to\nthe specified ARCH. If specified more than once on the command line, each ARCH\nis built sequentially.\n3.7.5.4.1 Example: Build -a option\n  # Build all modules in PacakgeOne DSC to IA32 arch\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -a IA32\n  # Build all modules in packageOne DSC to IA32 and X64 arch both\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -a IA32 -a X64\n\n3.7.5.5 Build Target (-b option)\nThe supported target is DEBUG and RELEASE, which are for the different compiler\noption settings. The module will be built under the specified target. If\nspecified more than once on the command line, each Target is built sequentially.\n3.7.5.5.1 Example: Build -b option\n  # Build all modules in PacakgeOne to IA32 arch\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -b DEBUG\n  # Build all modules in packageOne to IA32 and X64 arch both\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -b DEBUG -b RELEASE\n\n3.7.5.6 Build Tool Tag Name (-t option)\nTool tag name are defined in Conf\\Tools_def.txt file to represent a compiler\ntool chain. For example, MYTOOLS is a default tool tag name to Microsoft VS2005\ntool chain. The module will be built by the specified tool chain. If specified\nmore than once on the command line, each used tool chain is used sequentially.\n3.7.5.6.1 Example: Build -t option\n  # Build all modules in PacakgeOne by MYTOOLS tool chain\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -t MYTOOLS\n  # Build all modules in packageOne by MYTOOLS and ICC tool chain\n  Build -p PackageOnePackageOne.dsc -t MYTOOLS -t ICC\n\nIf the options given above are not specified with the build command, their\ndefault settings will be from Conf\\target.txt file. Details of build command\nare referenced in the EDK II User Manual 3.2.2 section.\nAfter applying the settings and build given above, the library and EFI image\ncan be generated into the build output directory. The build output directory is\nintroduced in detail in EDK II User Manual, section 3.3 The library is\ngenerated into the OUTPUT directory, and the EFI image is generated into the\nDEBUG directory.\n3.7.5.7 Example: Build HelloWorld\nBuild -p MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc -m\nMdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.inf -a IA32 -b DEBUG -t\nMYTOOLS\nHelloWorld.efi will be generated in DEBUG directory:\n$(WORKSAPCE)/Build/MdeModulePkg/DEBUG_MYTOOLS/IA32/MdeModulePkg/Applicati on/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/DEBUG, OUTPUT\nIn the build DEBUG directory, the following files are created: the EFI image, intermediate files, AutoGen.h, AutopGen.c and the Module.map file.\nAutoGen.h and AutopGen.c files are generated for each module by the EDK II build tool based on the required module information. They declare the dependent PCDs, Guid Values and include the module entry point related functions. Those AutoGen functions are referred to in the ModuleEntryPoint library instance. For each module, the entry point function first calls AutoGen code, then enters into module functions.\nModule.map is generated by a compiler tool to list all functions and their\nrelative addresses in this module. They can be used to locate the module\nfunction address at run time.\n3.7.6 Build EFI Option Rom image\nAn EFI Option Rom image is a standard EFI image. It can be built by the build\nmodule command mentioned in the section given above. The only difference is\nthat its INF includes the related PCI option in [Defines] section. When PCI\noption is set in the module INF, this module will be built to both EFI and\nOption Rom images. In the build DEBUG directory, ModuleName.efi and\nModuleName.rom will be generated.\nThe following example contains all PCI options required to create the EFI\noption rom image.\n3.7.6.1 Example: OptionRom INF-all PCI options\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION = 0x00010005\n  BASE_NAME   = OptionRomOne\n  FILE_GUID   = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  MODULE_TYPE = UEFI_DRIVER\n  ENTRY_POINT = UefiMain\n  # PCI option for VendorId, DeviceId, ClassCode and Revision\n  #\n  # PCI option is used to create PCI option rom image.\n  PCI_VENDOR_ID  = 0x8086\n  PCI_DEVICE_ID  = 0x29c2\n  PCI_CLASS_CODE = 0x030000\n  PCI_REVISION   = 0x1000\n\n[Sources.common]\n  OptionRom.c\n\n[Packages]\n  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  UefiBootServicesTableLib\n  UefiDriverEntryPoint\n  UefiLib\n  DebugLib\n\nOf the PCI options, VendorId, DeviceId and ClassCode are required.The PCI\nrevision is optional. If the PCI revision is not specified, the default\nrevision is 0x0.\n3.7.7 Common build module breaks\nThe following lists the common build module breaks and their fixes.\nerror 4000: Value of Guid [gCNameGuid] is not found under [Guids] section in\nMdePkg\\MdePkg.dec\nThe module INF is missing a package in the [Packages] section. The same error\ncan happen for any Guid, Ppi, Protocol, LibraryClass and PCD used by this\nmodule.

A different target causes\ndifferent build options. The \"BuildTarget\" field in target.txt works with the\n\"ToolChain\" field to determine the actual path of the compiler tool-chain and\nbuild option. Developers can directly open $(WORKSPACE)\\Conf\\target.txt \nand change \"TARGET = DEBUG\" for the debug tip. Developers also can use the command line to override this value, such as \"build -b DEBUG\" for debug tip.\n\nChoose the proper DebugLib library instance\nFor the DebugLib library class, MdePkg and IntelFrameworkModulePkg core\npackages provide several library instances, which include BaseDebugLibNull,\nBaseDebugLibSerialPort, UefiDebugLibConOut, UefiDebugLibStdErr, and\nPeiDxeDebugLibReportStatusCode. Developers can choose proper DebugLib library\ninstance in the package DSC file according to the actual requirements.\n\nConfigure the Pcds consumed by DebugLib\nThe DebugLib library class header defines two PCDs to be used for debug library\nconfiguration.\nThe PCDs related to debug ability include PcdDebugPropertyMask and\nPcdDebugPrintErrorLevel. The former is used to control enable/disable\nprint/assert abilities, and determines if the ASSERT macro is implemented\nthrough CpuDeadLoop or BreakPoint. For the latter, developers can set various\nvalues to control if the error information should be printed or filtered.\n\nChange build option\nDevelopers can modify or override the module build option. For example, a\ndeveloper can use the \"/Od\" option for the Microsoft compiler to disable the\noptimization of the compiler and avoid disordered instructions. The debug tip\ncan also use the \"/FAsc\" option for the Microsoft compiler to generate a\nsource and assembly (.cod) file to help debug.\n\n\n3.8.2 Basic debugging methods\nFollowing are three basic methods for debugging:\n\nUsing DEBUG print statement.\n\nIn EDK II project, there is a set of PCD to enable/disable debug capability.\nDeveloper can turn on the functionality when starting to debug. Therefore, the\nDEBUG print statements can be used to get information desired.\n\nCpuDeadLoop()\n\nDevelopers can use an API to halt control flow, which is helpful to find the\nlocation of an issue quickly.\n\nModule's Map file\n\nCurrently, EDK II generates a corresponding FV map file for every module.\nDevelopers can depend on the base address of a loaded module and map file to\ncalculate the memory address of functions.\n"},"4_uefi_applications/":{"url":"4_uefi_applications/","title":"4 UEFI Applications","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

For example:\n//\n// Template PPI\n//\nEFI_PEI_TEMPLATE_PPI gEfiTemplatePpi = {\n  Interface1,\n  Interface2,\n  Interface3\n};\nEFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR gPpiListTemplatePpi = {\n  (EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR_PPI | EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR_TERMINATE_LIST),\n  &gEfiTemplateGuid,\n  &gEfiTemplatePpi\n};\nEFI_STATUS\nPeimEntryPoint (\n  IN EFI_FFS_FILE_HEADER  *FfsHeader,\n  IN EFI_PEI_SERVICES     **PeiServices\n  )\n{\n  EFI_STATUS  Status;\n  //\n  // Publish Template PPI.\n  //\n  Status = PeiServicesInstallPpi (&gPpiListTemplatePpi);\n  return Status;\n}\n\n7.5.1.2 Locating a PPI\nIf Module B needs to invoke Interface2() provided by Template PPI, it can\nlocate Template PPI by using the following code:\n//\n// Get Template PPI\n//\nStatus = PeiServicesLocatePpi (\n           &gEfiTemplateGuid,\n           0,\n           NULL,\n           (VOID **)&TemplatePpi\n           );\nASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status);\n//\n// Invoke Interface2()\n//\nStatus = TemplatePpi->Interface2 (...);\nASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status);\n\n7.5.2 HOB\nPEIM modules can build a Hand-Off Block (HOB) to pass some information to the\nDXE Foundation and DXE modules. In addition, other PEIMs can obtain similar\ninformation from a HOB by using the HOB services in the Pei Service Table.\nIn EDK II, the Hob Library provides the generic interfaces to access HOBs for\nPEIMs and DXE drivers.\n7.5.3 PCD\nA PEIM can communicate with other PEIMs through dynamic PCDs. As with HOBs,\nonly PEIMs can obtain dynamic PCDs values, which were previously set by DXE\ndrivers. The usage of getting PCDs is introduced in Appendix A, Dynamic PCD.\n"},"7_pre-efi_initialization_modules/76_communicate_with_dxe_modules.html":{"url":"7_pre-efi_initialization_modules/76_communicate_with_dxe_modules.html","title":"7.6 Communicate with DXE Modules","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

PEIMs cannot write\nvariables.\nPEIMs can use ReadOnlyVariable2 PPI to obtain variables.

Variables\nare intended for use as a means to store data that is passed between the EFI\nenvironment implemented in the platform and EFI OS loaders and other\napplications that run in the EFI environment.\nA DXE driver can read and write variables via the UEFI Runtime Services\nGetVariable() and SetVariable().\n\nNote: These services are not available at the beginning of the DXE phase .\nThe PI Specification defines two architectural protocols to indicate the\nreadiness of read/write access to variables: EFIVARIABLE_ARCH_PROTOCOL and\nEFI_VARIABLE_WRITE_ARCH_PROTOCOL._\n\nDXE drivers that require read-only access or read/write access to volatile\nenvironment variables must have EFI_VARIABLE_ARCH_PROTOCOL in their\ndependency expressions.\nDXE drivers that require write access to nonvolatile environment variables must\nhave the EFI_VARIABLE_WRITE_ARCH_PROTOCOL in their dependency expressions.\nThe full complement of environment variable services is not available until\nboth EFI_VARIABLE_ARCH_PROTOCOL and EFI_VARIABLE_WRITE_ARCH_PROTOCOL are\ninstalled.\nSample code to read and write variables is as follows:\nEFI_STATUS\nReadAndWriteVariable (\n    IN CHAR16 *Name,\n    IN EFI_GUID *VendorGuid,\n){\n    EFI_STATUS Status;\n    UINTN BufferSize;\n    VOID *Buffer;\n    Buffer = NULL;\n    //\n    // Pass in a zero-size buffer to find the required buffer size.\n    //\n    BufferSize = 0;\n    Status = gRT->GetVariable (\n                    Name,\n                    VendorGuid,\n                    NULL,\n                    &BufferSize,\n                    Buffer\n                    );\n    //\n    // If variable exists, the Status should be EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL and\n    // BufferSize has been updated.\n    //\n    if (Status != EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL) {\n    return Status;\n    }\n    //\n    // Allocate the buffer according to updated BufferSize.\n    //\n    Buffer = AllocateZeroPool (BufferSize);\n    ASSERT (Buffer != NULL);\n    //\n    // Read variable into the allocated buffer.\n    //\n    Status = gRT->GetVariable (\n                    Name,\n                    VendorGuid,\n                    NULL,\n                    &BufferSize,\n                    Buffer\n                    );\n    if (EFI_ERROR (Status)) {\n    BufferSize = 0;\n    }\n    //\n    // TODO: Process of retrieved variable can be added here.\n    //\n    //\n    // Now write back the processed variable.\n    //\n    Status = gRT->SetVariable (\n                    Name,\n                    VendorGuid,\n                    EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS |\n                    EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS |\n                    EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE,\n                    BufferSize,\n                    Buffer\n                    );\n    ASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status);\n    return EFI_SUCCESS;\n}\n8.4.3 Dynamic PCD\nEDK II provides dynamic PCDs as a high-level mechanism for communication\nbetween modules.

The HOB list is\nprovided during the PEI phase, and must be treated as a read-only data\nstructure in the DXE phase. It conveys the state of the system at the time the\nDXE Foundation is started. The DXE drivers must not modify the contents of the\nHOB list.\nHobLib provides a set of APIs to build and parse a HOB list. Since DXE drivers\nonly read the HOB list, module writers of DXE drivers can focus on the APIs to\nparse HOB list.\nSeveral typical usage types are shown in examples below:\n8.5.1.1 Traversing all HOBs in the HOB list\nEFI_HOB_GENERIC_HEADER *Hob;\nUINT16 HobType;\nUINT16 HobLength;\nfor (Hob = GetHobList();\n     !END_OF_HOB_LIST (Hob); Hob = GET_NEXT_HOB (Hob))\n{\n  HobType = GET_HOB_TYPE (Hob);\n  HobLength = GET_HOB_LENGTH (Hob);\n  //\n  // Further operation on the HOB can be added\n  //\n}\n\n8.5.1.2 Retrieving only the first HOB of a specific type in the HOB list\n(CPU HOB type example)\nEFI_HOB_CPU *CpuHob;\nCpuHob = GetFirstHob (EFI_HOB_TYPE_CPU);\nif (CpuHob != NULL)   //\n{\n  // Operation on the HOB can be added here.\n  //\n}\n\n8.5.1.3 Traversing specific types of HOBs in the HOB list (CPU HOB type example)\nEFI_HOB_CPU *Hob;\nHob = GetHobList ();\nwhile ((Hob = GetNextHob (EFI_HOB_TYPE_CPU, Hob)) != NULL)   //\n{\n  // Operation on the HOB can be added here.\n  //\n  // At the end of loop, GET_NEXT_HOB must be added here.\n  // GetNextHob (\n       HobType, HobStart) does not skip the HOB passed by\n       // parameter HobStart. It returns HobStart back if HobStart itself\n       // meets the requirement. So it is required to use GET_NEXT_HOB() to\n       // skip current HOB. Otherwise, it would be in dead loop.\n       //\n       Hob = GET_NEXT_HOB (Hob\n       );\n}\n\n8.5.1.4 Retrieving only the first GUIDed HOB with a specific GUID in the HOB list\nEFI_HOB_GENERIC_HEADER *Hob;\nVOID *HobData;\nUINTN HobDataSize;\nHob = GetFirstGuidHob (&gAbcGuid);\nif (Hob != NULL)\n{\n  HobData = GET_GUID_HOB_DATA (Hob);\n  HobDataSize = GET_GUID_HOB_DATA_SIZE (Hob);\n  //\n  // Operation on the HOB can be added here.\n  //\n}\n\n8.5.1.5 Traversing GUIDed HOBs with a specific GUID in the HOB list\nEFI_HOB_GENERIC_HEADER *Hob;\nVOID *HobData;\nUINTN HobDataSize;\nHob = GetHobList ();\nwhile ((Hob = GetNextGuidHob (&gAbcGuid, Hob)) != NULL)\n{\n  HobData = GET_GUID_HOB_DATA (Hob);\n  HobDataSize = GET_GUID_HOB_DATA_SIZE (Hob);\n  //\n  // Operation on the HOB can be added here.\n  //\n  // At the end of loop, GET_NEXT_HOB must be added here.\n  // GetNextHob (\n       HobType, HobStart) does not skip the HOB passed by\n       // parameter HobStart.

More dependency requirement smay be inherited. Details\nfollows.\n\nModule writers must pay special attention to two points on dependency\nexpressions.\n\nA DXE driver inherits dependency expressions from all library instances it\nlinks with. The dependency expression listed in the module INF is a subset of\nthe dependency section in the PE32+ image built from this module. Linked\nlibrary instances are specified in DSC file.\n\nor\n\nA \"non-UEFI driver model\" driver's INF must have a dependency section. If\nTRUE is in INF's dependency section, because of inheritance, the generated\ndependency expression maybe not the TRUE.\n\nThe EDK II build tool would wipe out the dependency section in PE32+ image when\nit has exactly all architectural protocols.\n"},"8_dxe_drivers_non-uefi_drivers/87_handler_for_evtsignal_exit_boot_services.html":{"url":"8_dxe_drivers_non-uefi_drivers/87_handler_for_evtsignal_exit_boot_services.html","title":"8.7 Handler for EVT_SIGNAL_EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

If SetVirtualAddressMap() is called, then\nmodules of this type are relocated according to virtual address map provided by\nthe operating system.\nThe DXE Foundation is considered a boot service component, so the DXE\nFoundation is also released when ExitBootServices() is called. As a result,\nruntime drivers may not use any of the UEFI Boot Services, DXE Services, or\nservices produced by boot service drivers after ExitBootServices() is called.\nA DXE runtime driver defines MODULE_TYPE as DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER in the INF\nfile. In addition, because the DXE runtime driver encounters\nSetVirtualAddressMap() during its life cycle, it may need to register an\nevent handler for the event EVT_SIGNAL_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_CHANGE.\n8.8.1 INF File\nFollowing is the example of [Defines] section for a driver named\nSampleDriverRuntimeDxe.

In this case, the DXE runtime driver must create a\nsignal type event that is notified when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called by\nthe operating system.

For DXE SAL driver, the MODULE_TYPE entry should be as\nfollows:\n  DXE_SAL_DRIVER\n\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION = 0x00010005\n  BASE_NAME   = SampleDriverDxeSal\n  FILE_GUID   = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  MODULE_TYPE = DXE_SAL_DRIVER\n  ENTRY_POINT = SampleDxeSalDriverEntryPoint\n\n[Depex]\n  gSampleProtocolGuid\n\n8.9.2 Entry Point\nThe entry point of DXE SAL Driver must register the SAL services it produces.\nThe template code is as follows.\n\nNote: EDK II does not specify a detailed way for DXE SAL Drivers to produce\nand register SAL services.\n\nEFI_STATUS\nEFIAPI\nSampleDxeSalDriverEntryPoint (\n  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,\n  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable\n  )\n{\n  //\n  // More initialization can be added here.\n  //\n  //\n  // Event creation for EVT_SIGNAL_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_CHANGE can be added\n  // here.\n  //\n  //\n  // Register SAL services\n  //\n  return EFI_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n"},"8_dxe_drivers_non-uefi_drivers/810_dxe_smm_driver.html":{"url":"8_dxe_drivers_non-uefi_drivers/810_dxe_smm_driver.html","title":"8.10 DXE SMM Driver","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

As a\nresult, this module type is only available for IA-32 and x64 CPUs. These\nmodules are dispatched by SMM Foundation and are never destroyed. This means\nthe services that these modules produce are available after\nExitBootServices().\nThe lifecycle of SMM drivers can be divided into two phases, which have\ndifferent constraints. SMM Initialization:\nThis is the phase of SMM Driver initialization that starts with the call to the\ndriver's entry point and ends with the return from the driver's entry point.\nSMM Runtime:\nThis is the phase of SMM Driver initialization that starts after the return\nfrom the driver's entry point.\n8.10.1 INF File\nFollowing is the example of [Defines] section for a driver named\nSampleDriverDxeSmm. For a SMM driver, the MODULE_TYPE is DXE_SMM_DRIVER.\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION              = 0x00010005\n  BASE_NAME                = SampleDriverDxeSmm\n  FILE_GUID                = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  MODULE_TYPE              = DXE_SMM_DRIVER\n  PI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION = 0x0001000A\n  ENTRY_POINT              = SampleDxeSmmDriverEntryPoint\n\n[Depex]\n  gSampleProtocolGuid\n\n\nNote: PISPECIFICATIONVERSION should be definitely set to 0x0001000A for PI\n\n1.1 compliant SMM drivers.\n8.10.2 Constraints\nThe SMM driver model has constraints similar to those of DXE Runtime Drivers.\nInside of SMM Runtime, the drivers may not be able to use core protocol\nservices.\nThere are SMST-based services, which the drivers can access, but the UEFI\nSystem Table and other protocols installed during boot services may not\nnecessarily be available.\nInside of SMM Initialization, the full collection of UEFI Boot Services, UEFI\nRuntime Services and SMST-based services are available.\n8.10.2.1 SMM Driver Initialization\nAn SMM Driver's initialization phase begins when the driver is loaded into\nSMRAM, and its entry point is called. An SMM Driver's initialization phase ends\nwhen the entry point returns.\nDuring SMM Driver initialization, SMM Drivers have access to two sets of\nprotocols:\nUEFI protocols and SMM protocols.\nUEFI protocols are those installed and discovered using UEFI Boot Services.\nUEFI protocols can be located and used by SMM drivers only during SMM\nInitialization.\nSMM protocols are those installed and discovered using the System Management\nServices Table (SMST). SMM protocols can be discovered by SMM drivers during\ninitialization phase and SMM runtime phase.\nSMM Drivers must not use the UEFI Boot Services Exit() and\nExitBootServices() during SMM Driver Initialization.\n8.10.2.2 SMM Driver Runtime\nDuring SMM Driver runtime, SMM drivers only have access to SMST-based services.\nIn addition, depending on the platform architecture, memory areas outside of\nSMRAM may not be accessible to SMM Drivers. Likewise, memory areas inside of\nSMRAM may not be accessible to UEFI drivers.\nThese SMM Driver Runtime characteristics lead to several restrictions regarding\nthe usage of UEFI services:\n\nUEFI interfaces and services located during SMM Driver Initialization must\nnot be called or referenced during SMM Driver Runtime. This includes the EFI\nSystem Table, the UEFI Boot Services, and the UEFI Runtime Services.\n\nEvents created during SMM Driver Initialization must be closed before exiting\nthe driver entry point.\n\n\n"},"appendix_a_dynamic_pcd.html":{"url":"appendix_a_dynamic_pcd.html","title":"Appendix A Dynamic PCD","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

In contrast, the value of static type PCD (FeatureFlag,\nFixedPcd, PatchablePcd) is fixed in the final generated FD image during build\ntime.\nThe \"dynamic\" determination means one of three things:\n\nThe PCD setting value is produced and consumed by drivers during execution.\n\nThe PCD setting value is user configurable from setup.\n\nThe PCD setting value is produced by the platform OEM vendor in a specified\narea.\n\n\nA.1.1 Class of Dynamic Type\nAccording to module distribution way, dynamic PCD could be classified as:\nDynamic:\nIf module is released in source code and will be built with platform DSC, the\ndynamic PCD used by this module can be accessed as:\nPcdGetxx(PcdSampleDynamicPcd);\nIn building platform, the build tools translate PcdSampleDynamicPcd to the\nparameters Token Space Guid: Token Number for this PCD.\nDynamicEx:\nIf a module is released as binary and is not included in the platform build,\nthe dynamic PCD used by this module must be accessed as:\nPcdGetxxEx(gEfiMyTokenspaceGuid, PcdSampleDynamicPcd)\n\nNote: Developers need to explicitly pass Token SpaceGuid and TokenNumber as\nthe parameters.\n\nAccording to PCD value's storage method, dynamic PCD may be classified three\nways:\nDefault Storage:\nThe PCD value is stored in PCD database maintained by PCD driver in boot-time\nmemory.\nThis type is used for communication between PEIM/DXE drivers and DXE/DXE\ndrivers. All set/get value are lost after boot-time memory is turn off.\n[PcdsDynamicDefault] is used as the section name for this type of PCD in the platform DSC file.\n\n[PcdsDynamicExDefault] is used for dynamicEx types of PCDs.\n  Variable Storage:\n\nThe PCD value is stored in a variable area. As the default storage type, this\ntype of PCD could be used for PEI/DXE driver communication. Beside that, this\ntype PCD could also be used to store the value associate with a HII setting via\nvariable interface.\nIn PEI phase, the PCD value can be obtained but not set because the variable\narea is read only.\n[PcdsDynamicHii] is used as section name for this type of PCD in the platform DSC file.\n\n[PcdsDynamicExHii] is for the dynamicEx type of PCD.\n  OEM specified storage area:\n\nThe PCD value is stored in an OEM-specified area whose base address is\nspecified by the FixedAtBuild PCD setting PcdVpdBaseAddress.\nThe area is read only for PEI and DXE phases.\n[PcdsDynamicVpd] is used as section name for this type PCD in the platform DSC file.\n\n[PcdsDynamicExVpd] is for a dynamicex type of PCD.\n\nA.1.2 When and how to use dynamic PCD\nModule developers do not care if the PCD is dynamic or static when writing\nsource code/INF. Dynamic PCD and dynamic type are indicated by the platform\nintegrator in the platform DSC file.\n"}}}
