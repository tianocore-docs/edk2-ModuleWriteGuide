## 5.1 Begin With INF File

The [Defines] section of the INF must set `MODULE_TYPE` to `UEFI_DRIVER`.
Example:.

```ini
[Defines]
  INF_VERSION = 0x00010005
  BASE_NAME   = SampleDriverDxe
  FILE_GUID   = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
  MODULE_TYPE = UEFI_DRIVER
  ENTRY_POINT = SampleDriverEntryPoint
```

**********
**Note:** A UEFI driver has no [depex] section in the INF file. It always
depends on all dxe architectural protocols. To force this, the UEFI driver
entry point library instance appends all dxe architectural protocol dependency
relationships into the depex section of the module image.
**********

**********
**Note:** If module dependent on the new definitions/features in
EFI_BOOT_SERVICES/UEFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES defined in UEFI specifications from
version 2.1 forward, the hex version need to be given in INF file [Defines]
section's UEFI_SPECFIICATION_VERSION field.
