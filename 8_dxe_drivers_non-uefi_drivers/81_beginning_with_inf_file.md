## 8.1 Beginning with INF File

Each DXE Driver requires an Extended INF file. For basic introduction of INF
file, please refer to Section 3.2.2.

The `[Defines]` section for DXE driver should be modeled after the following.

**********
**Note:** The MODULE_TYPE entry must be DXE_DRIVER.
**********

```[Defines]

INF_VERSION = 0x00010005 
BASE_NAME = SampleDriverDxe 
FILE_GUID = XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX 
MODULE_TYPE = DXE_DRIVER 
ENTRY_POINT = SampleDriverEntryPoint 
[Depex] gSampleProtocolGuid 
```
**********
**Note:** If DXE module dependent on the new definitions/features in
DXE_SERVICES_TABLE defined in PI specifications from version 1.2 forward, the
hex version 0x0001000A needs to be given in INF file [Defines] section's
PI_SPECFIICATION_VERSION field.
**********

**********
**Note:** If module dependent on the new definitions/features in
EFI_BOOT_SERVICES/UEFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES defined in UEFI specifications from
version 2.1 forward, the hex version need to be given in INF file [Defines]
section's UEFI_SPECFIICATION_VERSION field.
**********
