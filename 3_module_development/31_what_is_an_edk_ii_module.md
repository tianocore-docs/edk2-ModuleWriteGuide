## 3.1 What is an EDK II module?

An EDK II module consists of source files or binary files and a module
definition file (INF file). An INF file describes a module's basic information
and interfaces such as consumed/produced library class/PCD/Protocol/Ppi/Guid.
(Please refer to the _EDK II Extended INF Specification_

A typical EDK II module is a firmware component that is built, put in an FFS
file and then put into a FV image. The component may be:

ï‚· A driver or application which is built to *.efi binary file and put into FFS
file as EFI_PE_SECTION:

* Raw data binary. For example, $(WORKSPACE)\MdeModulePkg\Logo\Logo.inf is a
  raw binary module which contains logo bitmap image.

* An option ROM driver that is put into a device's option ROM.

* A standalone UEFI driver

* A standalone UEFI application.

* A library instance that is built to a library object file (.lib) and
  statically linked to another module.

**********
**Note:** A module can be released in source code or in EFI binary format.

### 3.1.1 Module Type

EDK II defines many module types. The module type is used to:

* Indicate the lifecycle for different types of modules. For example, PEIM is
  dispatched in PEI phase and DXE_DRIVER or UEFI_DRIVER is dispatched at DXE
  phase;

* Indicate the binary image generation for different types of modules. For
  example, a PEIM/DXE_DRIVER type module can have "depex" section in .efi
  binary image; a UEFI_DRIVER can have .ui or .ver section in .efi binary image;

* Indicate EntryPoint() or Constructor() API for different types of modules.

* Indicate the suitable library instance for different types of modules. A
  library instance will point out what module types are supported in INF file.

| SEC                | Modules of this type are designed to start execution at the reset vector of a CPU. They are responsible for preparing the platform for the PEI Phase. Since there are no standard services defined for SEC, modules of this type follow the same rules as modules of type Base and typically include some amount of CPU specific assembly code to establish temporary memory for a stack. Modules of this type may optionally produce services that are passed to the PEI Phase in HOBs and those services must be compliant with the PI specification. |
| PEI_CORE           | This module type is used by PEI Core implementations that are complaint with the PI specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
